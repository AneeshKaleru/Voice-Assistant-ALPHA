A virtual assistant that has access to making intelligent decisions for routine user activities.

Description: This project was started on the premise that there is sufficient amount of openly available data on the 
web that can be utilized to build a virtual assistant that has access to making intelligent decisions for 
routine user activities. After exploration of various designs, we have created a specialized personal 
assistant software that improves user productivity by managing routine tasks of the user and by providing 
information from online sources to the user.
